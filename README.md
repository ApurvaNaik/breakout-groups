# Chi Hack Night join-a-breakout
*Experimental issues-only repo for connecting people and breakout groups*

## Adding your breakout group

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join
2. Open a new GitHub Issue in this repository: https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout/issues/new
2. Set the title of your issue to the name of your breakout
3. In the description, answer the following questions ([here's an example](https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout/issues/1)):
 * **About the group** A high level overview of your breakout group. What problem are you trying to solve? Make this simple and jargon-free. Links are good too!
 * **Group leaders** Names and contact info for the people running this group.
 * **Who we're looking for** Describe the kinds of people who would be good for your group. Include the skills, domain knowledge and interests that will help make your project succeed.
 * **Tools** Describe the tools that you are using.
 * **Relevant Links** Any relevant links, e.g. a github repo, a demo site
 * **Where we meet** Where in the Braintree office do you meet? Flipping Tables? The cafeteria? 
4. Add labels to your breakout group to help others find your group.
5. Click 'Submit new issue' and you're done!

## Why are we doing this?

Chi Hack Night wants to try a new way of announcing of breakout groups and we could use your help! Here's the idea:

Currently, announcements for breakout groups are based off this [semi-static list](https://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html) on the Chi Hack Night website. Research has shown that this has a few issues:

* If there are updates to a groups's description, Derek has to do them manually, which usually means that small but potentially helpful information isn't communicated in writing. This means that:
  * Groups that only exist for a few sessions usually don't show up on the list.
  * It's difficult for groups to communicate in writing the skillsets they're looking for week-to-week.
  * When information isn't written down, folks attending the event have to rely on memory to decide which project might be the best fit for them. As the number of groups at Chi Hack Night increases, this becomes increasingly challenging.
* If a group is absent, their info still shows up and takes up time during announcements.

We'd like to try a more dynamic format using [this list of GitHub issues](https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout/issues).
This will allow breakout group leaders to write their own group descriptions, either using a [suggested template](https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout/issues/1) or trying something else that they think will work. The hope is that these new descriptions can be more tailored towards attracting people with the skillsets that the group needs and edited as often as needed.

## Rules

1. Starting **Tuesday, June 21st**, Chi Hack Night will switch the old link of breakout groups over to the new list of GitHub issues and will announce groups based on that. We'll run this experiment for a couple of weeks and see how it goes.

2. Group issues will be marked as **Closed** if they aren't meeting at the current week's event, but can always be re-opened later.
