**About the group:** Just as other breakout groups hack on dozens of different civic tech issues, *How to Hack Night* hacks on Hack Night.

**Group leaders** Ethan Heppner -- heppnere@gmail.com or @eth on Slack

**Who we're looking for:** We're partly a working group and partly a feedback group, which means it's pretty open-ended. Come to us if:

* You're new, and you have additional questions after checking out [Civic Tech 101.](https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout/issues/9)
* You have ideas on how to make parts of Chi Hack Night better.
* You're curious about what makes Chi Hack Night work and want to share that with other hackathons.
* You have a background in operations, UX design, or data visualization and want to pitch in on getting feedback or working with the data we've collected.
* You thought that all of the Chi Hack Night projects sounded so awesome you couldn't decide which one you wanted to join! We do our best to help everyone a little bit.

**Tools and relevant links:**  [Google docs and sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9NynO8v_uIicm82aFg5WkpBc3M) to take notes, [GitHub to record issues](https://github.com/chihacknight/chihacknight-feedback/issues), and work with leadership using [Loomio to support decisions](https://www.loomio.org/g/CAQuMTfg/chi-hack-night). Open to suggestions as to additional tools and methods!

**What we're working on tonight**

Building a [dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11lBdBoBK2JK7rXgozx_4BIUkzgEPIVCaGrg7ttXVU-c/edit#gid=0) to present stats about Chi Hack Night!

**Where we meet:** Typically outside the Civic Tech 101 class.
